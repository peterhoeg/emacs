;;; Commentary:

;; Eshell, by using the pcomplete package, provides a full
;; programmable completion facility that is comparable to shells like
;; tcsh or zsh.
;;
;; Completions are context-sensitive, which means that pressing <TAB>
;; after the command 'rmdir' will result in a list of directories,
;; while doing so after 'rm' will result in a list of all file
;; entries.
;;
;; Many builtin completion rules are provided, for commands such as
;; `cvs', or RedHat's `rpm' utility.  Adding new completion rules is
;; no more difficult than writing a plain Lisp functions, and they can
;; be debugged, profiled, and compiled using exactly the same
;; facilities (since in fact, they *are* just Lisp functions).  See
;; the definition of the function `pcomplete/make' for an example of
;; how to write a completion function.
;;
;; The completion facility is very easy to use.  Just press TAB.  If
;; there are a large number of possible completions, a buffer will
;; appear showing a list of them.  Completions may be selected from
;; that buffer using the mouse.  If no completion is selected, and the
;; user starts doing something else, the display buffer will
;; automatically disappear.
;;
;; If the list of possible completions is very small, Eshell will
;; "cycle" through them, selecting a different entry each time <TAB>
;; is pressed.  <S-TAB> may be used to cycle in the opposite
;; direction.
;;
;; Glob patterns can also be cycled.  For example, entering 'echo
;; x*<tab>' will cycle through all the filenames beginning with 'x'.
;; This is done because the glob list is treated as though it were a
;; list of possible completions.  Pressing <C-c SPC> will insert all
;; of the matching glob patterns at point.
;;
;; If a Lisp form is being entered, <TAB> will complete the Lisp
;; symbol name, in exactly the same way that <M-TAB> does in Emacs
;; Lisp mode.
;;
;; The list of possible completions can be viewed at any point by
;; pressing <M-?>.
;;
;; Finally, context-related help can be accessed by pressing <C-c M-h>.
;; This only works well if the completion function has provided Eshell
;; with sufficient pointers to locate the relevant help text.
